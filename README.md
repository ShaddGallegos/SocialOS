# SocialOS
My idea for a social os
I was out throwing rocks in a lake with my son and the ripples in the water gave me an idea  as they connected and interacted with eachother

SocialOS would be you are the Admin, to start out you have an app that allows you add users, you choose the applications that group has access to, then you choose a format for your end user iso(live os), VM, or container. Your users can then run it on their desktop without having to compromise their system. they would have an intranet between the users. 

Inturn if they choose they can install it on their computer and become an admin node and create their own groups as well

who needs twitter or youtube you could have your own private setup (you would still have access to those items if your group has internet access)
